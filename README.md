# PriSag


Welcome to PriSag!We are basically a team of young programmers from VNIT NAGPUR, who have great interest in the field of Coding and Web & App Development irrespective of our branches.Taking the responsibility as the Sophomore, we have plans for helping the young students who dream to work in the field of programming and see themselves as future developers. We also have an interest in taking projects for various college clubs for their very first own responsive website. Interested people can contact us!..

# Projects!

We've done CS50 psets which had the application of C, HTML5, CSS, PHP, JAVASCRIPT, SQL, Django.<br>One of them is pset8 MASHUP, a project of CS50.Currently, we are working on CS75(building dynamic website) based on PHP, JS, JSON, AJAX. This website is a part of it too. We've also made several websites for college clubs and are planning to release a few apps soon. We're also working on VNIT's [Student Portal]



### Tech

Prisag uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
* [Django] - We love it!
* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [jQuery] - duh

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.



**Happy Coding!**
